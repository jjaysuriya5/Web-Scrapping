We also place orders for Veg Biryani and Special Chicken Biryani whenever we go there.

If you are going then please try Rainbow Biryani or Rainbow Masala with roti/nan. Then don't have that in the menu, just ask for it explicitly.Cost effective as well as good quality is what I have observed. The main issue here is we mostly visit this place on Friday's for lunch we have to wait a lot for grabbing a table. Chicken dum biryani, Apollo fish , barbecue chicken etc are there specials which I like the most.It's a proper Hyderabadi biryani joint.
